# Simple Dropdown Menu by Sam's Dev Lab

Custom-created dropdown menu as a practice for creating and implementing custom npm packages.

Created @samsdevlab/toggle-visibility in a separate project/repo, imported to this project and implemented it.

This package simply toggles the visibility of an element.
